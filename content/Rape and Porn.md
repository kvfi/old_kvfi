&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970, Nixons' Commission on Obscenity and Pornography concluded that were no anti-social and subsersive corollaries from exposure to pornography, which led to another Commission in 1980, this time, showing the inverse: there was a causal link between viewing pornography and sexual violence toward women (Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, 1986). Last Febuary, during a Yale seminar on public policy, I met with Anthony D’Amato[^damato], a Northwestern Law School professor who served as consulant to President Nixon’s Commission on Obscenity in 1970. Mr. D'Amato was not summoned to take part in the second Commission, notwithstanding being a stated policy-maker. A political injunction he says, that the Commission was searching "political truth" rather than delivering a well-founded report. Mr. D'amato published in 1990 a critic[^damato_political_truth] exposing how the Commission  backed policies endeavoured by the governement.

The drafter of the Commission’s report was Frederich Schauer, a prominent law professor. In a seperate statement[^schauer_statement], he ensured that none of the commissionners was under the influence of personal moral values. An argument that one may find dismissive. How could social factors change so significantly under a decade to switch from non-causality to causality?

So how do we explain a 85% drop in U.S. rape rate in the last 25 years while access to pornography became exponentially easier? Officials explain it as a result of public policy

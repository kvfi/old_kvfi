Howdy young Internet traveler,

This is [a semi-personal knowledge base](./About) I've been building for the last 12 years. I mostly write correlative studies — although I made critics of it (see [_“The uncertainty of pseudo-factuality”_](./post/uncertainty-of-pseudofactuality)), [book reviews](./Book_reviews), maintain a [list of topics](./Topics) I'm intrigued in, carry out [experiments](./Experiments) and do [predictions](./Predictions).

If you want to start to read some of my essays, I would recommand my finest work, [“Introduction to logic theory for non-mathematicians”](./post/introduction-logic-theory), (which is BTW also included in [my best writings list](./Best_work_list)), or begin by [_“How to read this blog”_](./Reading_SCIFML) (a guide that highlights my writing/publishing procedures).

Anyway, you're most welcome.

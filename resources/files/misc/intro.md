During the last 12 years I managed to amass a body of work that some may find of interest. Parts of it are public and others are kept private for seclusion.

It's more like an open journal I use to gather information and miscellaneous thoughts on various topics. Over the years I've been running this site, I accumulated sizeable content including and because I've never really thought of publishing my writings in books or magazines.

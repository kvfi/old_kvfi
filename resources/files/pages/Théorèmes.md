As a mathematician, I sometimes happen to leave my department &ndash; desk &ndash; go meet people outside academia and have interesting chats.

Doesn't occur that often, though.

During my not-so-many discussions I've noticed that many of my French-speaking acquaintances are showing great interest in generalized aspects of mathematics. Though they wish to understand deeper notions, most of them are not anywhere close to knowing any of the many mathematical fundamentals. I'm amazing how little they grasp of theorems, that math is more than doing arithmetic. Some even like to unobtrusively mention that their favorite class in high school was math. And today, as they are grown-ups, have each a career of their own, are still puzzled by the mother of all sciences. The problem being there is no real alternative to learning complex theorems, and I found myself many times unable to explain some concepts because of the gap between high-level mathematics and the non-existence of simple and aphoristic vocabulary. So people compromised on math being out of reach for the common people.

I've been thinking about this situation for a while and I decided to create a serie of self-contained explanations of mathematical thoerems. Every day, I'll post a brief simplification, using straightforward concepts and real-world applications (in French).

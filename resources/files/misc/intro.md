&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="big">For as long as I remember</span> I've been trying to fuse science and arts together, altought I did it with limited and moderate success. During the last 12 years I managed to amass a body of work that some may find of interest. Parts of it are public and others are kept private for seclusion. I write about everything I find worth taking a look at. Although it resembles it, this is not a blog&mdash; at least don't call it so. It's more like an open journal I use to gather information and miscellaneous thoughts on various topics. Over the years I've been running this site, I accumulated sizeable content including and because I've never really thought of publishing my writings in books or magazines.

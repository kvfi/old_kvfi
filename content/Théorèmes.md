Discussions with non-mathematicians&mdash;and people outside academia&mdash;made me notice that lots of acquaintances are showing great interest in generalized aspects of mathematics. Though they wish to understand deeper notions, most of them are not anywhere close to knowing any of the many [mathematical fundamentals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_mathematics). I'm sometimes amazed by how little they grasp of what mathematics is really about, that it is more than making your brain heat.
Some even like to unobtrusively mention that their favorite class in high school was math. And today, as they are grown-ups, have each a career of their own, are still puzzled by the mother of all sciences. The problem being there is no real alternative to learning complex theorems, and I found myself many times unable to explain some concepts because of the gap between high-level mathematics and the non-existence of simple and [aphoristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism) vocabulary. So people compromised on math being out of reach for the common people.

I've been thinking about this situation for a while and I decided to create a serie of self-contained explanations of mathematical thoerems. Every day, I'll post a brief simplification, using straightforward concepts and real-world applications (in French).

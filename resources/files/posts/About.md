> If you want to really hurt you parents, and you don't have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possible can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something. [^Kurt Vonnegut]

I won't be introducing myself using purposeless information such as where I'm from, where I grew up, what diet I'm on or how many ovum I fertilized. Apart from the unproductive result, I've a leaning for strong privacy due to my views and backslash it could eventually provoke. In _[“The drawbacks of having an opinion”](/post/drawbacks-opinion)_, I explain why I chose anonymity and how it allows me to remain watchful (I also try to show that opinion and conviction can obscure self-determination). Although I give more immunity to personality traits (described bellow).

#### Profile {#profile}
> How often do we tell our own life story? How often do we adjust, embellish, make sly cuts? And the longer life goes on, the fewer are those around to challenge our account, to remind us that our life is not our life, merely the story we have told about our life. Told to others, but—mainly—to ourselves. [^The Sense of an Ending]

I'm a mathematician, formerly employed in academia, currently working for corporate banking. I consider myself a nomad since I didn't stay in the same place 2 years in a row for a while now. My socialistic ingredients are quiet peculiar for various reasons, mainly because I tend to deny [self-categorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-categorization_theory) and stay away from any [group homogeneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups). It's probably the point why I decline to grant people any introduction to myself. I think preferable to people to describe me.

I believe that accurate and serviceable knowledge prevails over any kind of nugatory assumption. So, are considered pure persona and mental traits only, based on [Revised NEO Personality Inventory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory) which presents factual personality dimensions and facets.

#### Personality {#personality}

According to the [five factor model (FFM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits), is, as stated by its Wikipedia page[^FFM], I'm a [O76-C52-E31-A63-N11](http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/results/?oR=0.825&cR=0.611&eR=0.469&aR=0.722&nR=0.281), which boils down to the following:

* [Openness to Experience/Intellect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience): I'm relatively open to new experiences &mdash; Percentile: 76
* [Conscientiousness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness%23Personality%20models): I'm neither organized or disorganized &mdash; Percentile: 52
* [Extraversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion): I tend to shy away from social situations &mdash; Percentile: 31
* [Agreeableness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness): I tend to consider the feelings of others &mdash; Percentile: 63
* [Neuroticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism): I probably remain calm, even in tense situations &mdash; Percentile: 11

Although I was diagnosed at the age of 4 with Asperger's syndrome, I've never been through any important troubles due to my mental irregularity. Even supposing that I sustain some sort of social malaise and general discomfort when it comes to daily interaction tasks, one can argue that I have a [schizoid personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder).

#### This website {#website}
This blog is a personal database of thoughts, ideas and notes I'm maintaining for about 12 years now. I use it mainly to share itemized information on various topics and subjects. The website is spit into two separate segments: topics (talking points I feed with information) and **posts** (daily notes, correlative studies, experiments, graphics, etc.). Because I don't use [social network](./Facebook) or any other type of plateform to adverstise myself, it makes following my writings quiet a challenge. I address this by sending a monthly [newsletter](./Newsletter), containing both my last writing, [changelogs](./Changelog) and reading list (a inventory of links/books I found of interest).

##### Epistemic state {#epistemic}
On every post, article that is written by me, you may notice the presence of a _meta-tag_ named “epistemic state”. This meta-tag is used to average the level of confidence I have in what I write. It is tracked and allows, both me and my readers, to wary of my beliefs, and monitor my opinion variation. Up to this day here are the _epistemic states_ I've used:

* “believed”: I'm strongly conviced by what I wrote, it translates my conviction and writing ethics. I regard as true the content. When I use the term _correct_, it means that I have the utmost trust and credence in the topic. I call for people to be able to constitute an anti-proof to my claims, submit counterevidence or disprove my assertion.
* “semi-believed”: Although I'm fairly confident in the content, I assume there is a small room for improvement and refinement.
* “not believed”: I dont rely anymore on the content, or I changed opinion since, gainsaid in other posts.
* “log”: A diversified cluster of unorganised, confusing and heterogeneous thoughts. See _[Notes](./Notes)_.
* “fiction”: Imaginative writing based on unrealistic/quixotic facts. It's a way to let my imagination make its way using a  dreamed-up fantasy.
* “emotional”: Claims and statements are made with peculiar emotions as foundation. Don't take it thoughtfully.

#### Contact {#contact}
* Email: <a href="mailto:hey@scif.ml">hey@scif.ml</a>. I don't use social media.
* [PGP key](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x288F609565D98527); fingerprint `65D98527`

[^FFM]: FFM is a widely examined theory of five broad dimensions used by some psychologists to describe the human personality and psyche. The five factors have been defined as openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Acronyms to aid in remembering the five traits include OCEAN and CANOE. Beneath each proposed global factor, a number of correlated and more specific primary factors are claimed. For example, extroversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions &mdash; _Big Five personality traits_ on Wikipedia [Big Five personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big‰20Five‰20personality‰20traits)

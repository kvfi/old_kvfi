&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For as long as I remember I tried to fuse science and arts, altought I did it with limited and moderate success. For the last 12 years, I managed to amass a body of work that some may find of interest. Parts of it are public and others are kept private for seclusion. I write about everything I find interesting or worth taking a look at. Altough it resembles it, this is not a [[blog|Blog]]&mdash; at least don't call it so. It's an open journal I use to gather information and miscelenous thoughts on various topics. Be advised that I follow [[Crocker's rules|Crocker's rules]].

Anyway, you're most welcome. If you happen to have a question or remark, please do [contact me](./About#contact).

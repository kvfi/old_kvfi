&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This essay won't be about ‘unemployment’ as such&mdash;due to the entanglement of the phenomenon and its imbalance regarding the economy in which it occurs. It will bring into focus a hypercritical theme known as [underemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underemployment), which consequences are relativly and often times disregarded, or obscured as an answer to long-term unemployement. I will attempt to define the true nature of underemployment, its effects and the consideration it has been given both in reasearch and public policy. One strong point I will strive to make is that unlike ‘unemployment’, underunemployment has an elaborate noxious structual mechanism that makes it hard be dealt with, hence the need to take suited measures.

#### Defining the concept of underemployment
Underemployment is relative
> Underemployment is defined somehow as an inferior, lesser, or lower quality type of employment. In addition, underemployment is defined relative to some standard. In some cases, under-employment is defined relative to the employment experiences of others with the same education or work history; in other cases, underemployment is defined rela-tive to the person’s own past education or work history. _Feldman, 1996._ [^nature_underemployment_d_fieldman]

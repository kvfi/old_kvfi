Let's be clear, Uber does **not** contribute to any kind of [sharing economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy). It would be giving a social dimension to a company offering mishandling technology to its customers. Uber's goal is to destroy its competitors by instituting ultra-low fares. The company is able to do so because of its immense venture capital valuation of \$69 billion based on a direct \$13 billion investment. The company is losing \$2 billion a year as passengers pay for only [41% of the ride](http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2016/12/02/uber-losses.html). Uber's plan is to create a [winner-take-all market](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/winner-takes-all-market.asp), earn billions in returns and replace their human drivers by [driverless cars](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-08-18/uber-s-first-self-driving-fleet-arrives-in-pittsburgh-this-month-is06r7on).

> If you happened to be involved in an incident with an Uber cab, because the driver carries only a regular licence (not a commercial one, like they are supposed to), you won't be covered for any bodily injury. This is because Uber doesn't own cars. It is a technology company not a transportation one.


#### Reasons not to use Uber
* Uber requires its users to identify themselves.

* Uber gave U.S. government and agencies [data on more than 12m users](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-tech-data-idUSKCN0X91R5). In 85% of the cases, Uber provides data on request.

* Uber [tracks its custumers](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/12/01/503985473/uber-now-tracks-passengers-locations-even-after-theyre-dropped-off) before and after they're dropped off.

* [Incidents](http://www.whosdrivingyou.org/rideshare-incidents) directly involving Uber are frequent.

* A senior Uber executive [suggested investigating the personal life of a journalist](https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists) who criticized the company.

* Uber's business model is [apocryphal](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/12/01/2180647/the-taxi-unicorns-new-clothes/)[^apocryphal]. The company promises big payouts but drivers are barely paid minimum wages. Uber's relies on driver not understand their own economics.

* JPMorgan and DeutscheBank [refused to sell Uber stocks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-07/banks-said-to-have-passed-up-uber-share-sale-on-lack-of-data) on no financials and lack of specifics. Deutsche was supposed to sell the Uber shares through the bank's private-wealth division, which would be a first for a financial product. This story is similar to [Goldman Sachs Group selling private stocks of Facebook to people outside](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/goldman-limits-facebook-investment-to-foreign-clients/?src=twt&twt=nytimesbusiness) of the U.S. before the company went public in 2012.

* Uber operates in a [nearly-unregulated market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire), the company can cut rates at any given moment.

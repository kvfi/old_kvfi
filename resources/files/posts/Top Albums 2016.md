This is this time of the year again during which I list my favorite music releases of the year. And 2016's been a good year as for records. From digging deeper in [horrorcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horrorcore) to reconciling myself with death metal, the release of an unexpected [A Tribe Called Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tribe_Called_Quest) tape after the [sorrowful death](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/a-tribe-called-quests-phife-dawg-dead-at-45-20160323) of Phife Dawg.
As Nails releases a solid and dark 3-track LP tinted by their most abrasive material, I found myself glad to listen to a dismaying ACxDC and audacious 胡蝶の夢、十の夜's tape. Though I must admit I was hoping a way more enterprising Flatbush Zombies' [“3001: A Laced Odyssey”](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/3001-a-laced-odyssey/id1078051629) &ndash; probably my only delusive arrival.

I look forward to listening Pouya/Fat Nick mixtape that should be put out later in December, which would wind up this year's musical wandering.

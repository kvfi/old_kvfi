&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blog is a [semi-personal knowledge base](./About) I've been building for the last 12 years. I mostly write about mathematics, computer science and philosophy. I also do correlative studies&mdash;although I [criticized pseudo-factuality](./Pseudofacts), [book reviews](./Book%20reviews), maintain a versioned [notes](./Notes) page, carry out experiments and do predictions. I also happen to do [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf).

If you want to start to read some of my essays, I would recommand my finest work, [“Logic theory for non-mathematicians”](./Logic%20for%20non-mathematicians), (which is by the way listed in [my best writings list](./Best%20work)), you might also start by [_“How to read this blog”_](./Reading%20this%20blog) (a guide that highlights my writing and publishing procedures).

Anyway, you're most welcome.

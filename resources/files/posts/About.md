> If you want to really hurt you parents, and you don't have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possible can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something. [^first_quote]

I won't be introducing myself using purposeless information such as where I'm from, where I grew up, giving a c, what diet I'm on or how many ovum I fertilized. Apart from the unproductive result, I've a leaning for strong privacy due to my views and backslash it could eventually provoke. In _[“The drawbacks of having an opinion”](/post/drawbacks-opinion)_, I explain why I chose anonymity and how it allows me to remain watchful (I also try to show that opinion and conviction can obscure self-determination). Although I give more immunity to personality traits (described bellow).

#### Profile {#profile}
> How often do we tell our own life story? How often do we adjust, embellish, make sly cuts? And the longer life goes on, the fewer are those around to challenge our account, to remind us that our life is not our life, merely the story we have told about our life. Told to others, but—mainly—to ourselves. [^The Sense of an Ending]

I'm a mathematician, employed in academia. I consider myself a nomad since I didn't stay in the same place 2 years in a row for a while now. My socialistic ingredients are quiet peculiar for various reasons, mainly because I tend to deny [self-categorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-categorization_theory) and stay away from any [group homogeneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups). It's probably the point why I decline to grant people any introduction to myself. I think preferable to people to describe me.

I believe that accurate and serviceable knowledge prevails over any kind of nugatory assumption. So, are considered pure persona and mental traits only, based on [Revised NEO Personality Inventory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory) which presents factual personality dimensions and facets.

#### Personality {#personality}

According to the [five factor model (FFM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits), is, as stated by its Wikipedia page[^FFM], I'm a [O76-C52-E31-A63-N11](http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/results/?oR=0.825&cR=0.611&eR=0.469&aR=0.722&nR=0.281), which boils down to the following:

* [Openness to Experience/Intellect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience): I'm relatively open to new experiences &mdash; Percentile: 76
* [Conscientiousness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness%23Personality%20models): I'm neither organized or disorganized &mdash; Percentile: 52
* [Extraversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion): I tend to shy away from social situations &mdash; Percentile: 31

Although I was diagnosed at the age of 4 with Asperger's syndrome, I've never been through any important troubles due to my mental irregularity. Even supposing that I sustain some sort of social malaise and general discomfort when it comes to daily interaction tasks, one can argue that I have a [schizoid personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder).

[^FFM]: FFM is a widely examined theory of five broad dimensions used by some psychologists to describe the human personality and psyche. The five factors have been defined as openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Acronyms to aid in remembering the five traits include OCEAN and CANOE. Beneath each proposed global factor, a number of correlated and more specific primary factors are claimed. For example, extroversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions &mdash; _Big Five personality traits_ on Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big Five personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big Five personality traits)

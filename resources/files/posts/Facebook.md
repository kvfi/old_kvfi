I don't use Facebook anymore. I was amongst the first 1000 users to join Facebook in 2005 when its co-founder [Dustin Moskovitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Moskovitz) sent invite-only memberships to students and open source activists in Europe. It was a promising project but "the Facebook" got way out of hand. I stopped using it.

Putting the photo of someone on Facebook (or Instagram) contributes to surveillance of that person. Please don't post any photos there that include me, and I suggest you avoid posting photos of anyone else too.

#### Real Names {#real_name}
Facebook requires useds to use their 'real' (the name they normally go
by as defined by Facebook) on the site or risk having their accounts
suspended.

* Facebook is not your friend.  Its 'real name' policy is enough reason
to refuse to let it use you, but there is so much more nastiness in Facebook.
* Facebook spontaneously asked its useds questions
<a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-snitch-on-friends-that-arent-using-real-names/">
trying to expose
useds who had not given their real names</a>.
* Facebook with its 'real name' policy <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/24/facebook-real-name-policy-drag-performers-outing">makes
itself the arbiter of other people's selves</a>.
* Under pressure from cross-dressers, Facebook said it would relax the
'real name' policy and allow people to use aliases, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/01/victory-drag-queens-facebook-apologises-real-name-policy">but
only if they are generally known by those aliases</a> or if they were
victims of certain types of abuse or stalking.

This relieves a very specific acute problem, but does not enable
ordinary people to use Facebook without being tracked.

* However, reportedly Facebook <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/25/women-lgbt-safety-facebook-policy/">has not really changed the policy</a>. Even if Facebook makes this change, it will be unacceptable because
companies and the state will be able to connect the account with your
real identity.  In order for the site not to mistreat people, it must
let you have one account to show your boss and your parents, another
for your friends, and others for various kinds of political
activism.
* What happened to Koko the clown demonstrates why it is very
<a href="http://www.latrobevalleyexpress.com.au/story/4253256/identity-crisis-for-koko-the-clown/">
foolish to talk with your clients through Facebook</a> or to keep any important
information in a Facebook account.
* Facebook makes a practice of <a href="http://owni.eu/2012/07/24/facebook-added-informant/">asking</a>
its useds<a href="#used">*</a> to rat on their friends who use aliases.
* People who don't dare identify themselves feel compelled to be used by
Facebook, so they register under pseudonyms, which makes them
<a href="http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/001133.html">
vulnerable to blackmail by those who threaten to report their real
names</a> to Facebook.
* These people feel compelled to be useds of Facebook because
their friends and relatives are useds of Facebook.  In other words,
their friends and relatives are victim-coperpetrators: initially
victims of Facebook, they contribute to its wrongs by pressuring
others to be useds of Facebook.
* Don't do this to others &mdash; don't be used by Facebook yourself!
* Facebook silently changed its search system to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/29/facebook-privacy-secret-profile-exposed">expose
the existence of hidden accounts</a>.

#### Censorship {#censorship}
##### Political Censorship {#political_censorship}
Facebook has frequently removed postings about protests (both planned and ongoing), political satire, and various political issues. Specific examples are given below.

* Facebook deleted the news item announcing a <a href="http://www.march-against-monsanto.com/facebook-censored-and-deleted-march-against-monsanto-event">
major protest against Monsanto</a>.
* Facebook <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/23/world/europe/facebook-angers-russian-opposition-by-blocking-protest-page.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">
blocked a page announcing a protest</a> in Russia obeying orders
from the Russian government. The order says the protest is illegal.  In a tyrannical state,
protests are generally illegal.
* Facebook has yielded to Turkey's
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/27/facebook-blocks-turkish-page-insults-prophet-muhammad">religious
censorship</a>, just as previously it yielded to China's
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2011-mar-jun.html#01_May_2011_(Urgent:_Urge_Facebook_not_to_partner_with_censors)">political censorship</a>.
* Facebook has developed
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/23/facebook-secret-software-censor-user-posts-china">software
to allow various countries to directly control censorship</a> of what
useds in that country can see.
* Jim Wright forcefully condemned the pressure put on Americans to
endorse all the bellicose or dangerous "responses" to the September 11
attacks. Facebook <a href="http://www.stonekettle.com/2016/09/renegade-911.html">censored
it</a>, apparently for political reasons.

This shows the danger of depending on Facebook.

* Facebook <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/13/facebook-turkish-government-zed-books">deleted
without explanation the page of a publisher in the UK</a> that had posted
articles about publications that criticize Erdo&gbreve;an. The article shows that Facebook has censored on behalf of
Erdo&gbreve;an before.
* Facebook has a <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120418/15531718548/facebook-blocking-stories-about-richard-odwyers-fight-against-extradition-to-us.shtml">
history of blocking the posting of links</a> about certain
controversial political issues.
* Facebook
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/12/facebook-blocks-shaun-king-black-lives-matter">blocked
the account of activist Shaun King</a> after he posted a racist email
that was sent to him.
* Algorithmic filtering can affect history, not just hide history. Facebook's filtering algorithm <a href="https://medium.com/message/ferguson-is-also-a-net-neutrality-issue-6d2f3db51eb0">suppressed
news about the riot by uniformed thugs in Ferguson until after it
became national news.</a>
* Facebook <a href="http://gawker.com/5885714/">censorship
guidelines</a> have been leaked.  They include political censorship
catering to various countries that do not respect freedom of speech.
* Facebook has <a href="http://tompride.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/facebook-censors-political-satire-after-complaint-from-jobcentre-plus/">censored
political satire</a> aimed at the UK unemployment agency and
associated organizations, apparently at the request of a target of the
satire.
* Facebook has
<a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/en/On-Facebook-antiracists-censorship">censored
a number of French anti-racist campaigners</a>.

#### Journalism {#journalism}
* <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/20/facebook-bans-breast-cancer-video-square-breasts">
Facebook banned a video made by the Swedish Cancer Society</a> about
breast cancer because it showed cartoon figures with circles as
breasts. It got Facebook to accept the video by putting in squares for the
breasts. The real problem here is not that Facebook draws the line at the wrong
place (though it does).  It is that Facebook has so much influence
that organizations such cancer charities feel obliged to publish
through Facebook.
* <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-national-security/naked-statue-reveals-one-thing-facebook-censorship">Facebook
censored an ACLU post about censorship.</a>
* Facebook <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/06/15/facebook-news-censorship/">deletes postings</a> for obscure reasons, and even denies deleting them.  It is not safe as a platform for journalism.
* By the way, I cannot understand why people make a fuss about just how
they find out that someone they loved is dead.  Compared to the fact
of that person's death, such details seem insignificant.
* If Facebook achieves its goal of becoming the main publication site
for journalism, it will be a new chokepoint for
<a href="http://www.cjr.org/criticism/facebook_news_censorship.php">censorship</a>.
* Facebook wants to present itself as a
<a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech-technology-and-liberty/political-speech-facebook">virtual
town square</a> &hellip; a censored one.
* Facebook <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/06/facebook-apologises-free-speech-syria">deleted a statement by a human rights group</a>, then said that was a mistake.
That Facebook invited the group to post the statement again &mdash; instead of undoing the deletion &mdash; demonstrates arrogance. However, the problem here goes deeper.  It is not good for human rights groups' (or anyone's) statements to be posted using a platform where statements are censored.

#### Personal {#personal}
* Facebook arbitrarily <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/facebook-reforms-inmate-account-takedown-process">censors and closes the accounts of prisoners</a>.
* <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/feb/21/facebook-nudity-violence-censorship-guidelines">Facebook
does censorship of photos based on prudish criteria.</a>
* Facebook did an experiment in biasing the filtering of useds'<a href="#used">*</a> news feeds (which are always filtered by Facebook in other ways) towards the emotionally positive or the emotionally negative.  This experiment
was widely condemned as "unethical" based on details, but this criticism was naive in that it <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/06/we-shouldnt-expect-facebook-to-behave-ethically">disregarded
the fundamentally unethical nature of Facebook</a>.
* Facebook <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/04/19/richard-metzger-how.html">deleted a photo of two men kissing</a>, which was used to support a kiss-in in a pub that had shown bias against gays.The person who posted it thinks that Facebook is not anti-gay, but rather than it is quick to censor whatever someone complains about.While it might seem that the former would be worse, I think the latter makes Facebook really dangerous. Don't use Facebook as a substitute for your own web site!
* Facebook <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/social-media/Facebook-draws-flak-for-deleting-photo-of-gay-Sikh-kissing-another-man/articleshow/27658360.cms">
censored a photo of two men kissing</a>, posted as a protest
against India's criminalization of homosexuality.

#### Privacy {#privacy}
##### Personal Data {#personal_data}
* Facebook's "conversation topics" experiment <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2016/oct/18/facebook-messenger-conversation-topic-telling-everyone-everything-i-do"> actively shows certain selected useds everything</a> that their "friends" are doing.
* A detailed, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/08/19/98-personal-data-points-that-facebook-uses-to-target-ads-to-you/"> long list of the data Facebook collects about each used</a>, for targeting ads. Facebook may collect other information which is not used for targeting ads.
* Facebook bought WhatsApp and committed not to combine that data with Facebook's other data. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/25/whatsapp-backlash-facebook-data-privacy-users">Now it is going to do just that.</a> For Facebook, any commitment is meant to be broken, after a delay for people to forget about it.
* The Facebook app obtained useds' <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/joshua-/61105.html"> whole contact lists</a>, either directly grabbing them or by tricking useds into agreeing without knowing it. You have to expect a nonfree program to be malicious.
* Facebook's app has started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605165148/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/10/facebook_scans_camera_for_your_friends/">scanning photos</a> people take with their phones.
The article says "camera", but that word is misleading; cameras do not
have a Facebook app installed in them.  This applies only to phones and
tablets. I suspect the face recognition is done by sending the photos to a Facebook server.  If so, the server could do other things with those photos.  It could save them and send them to Big Brother.  From now on,
when people want to snap me with a mobile, I will verify it does not
have a Facebook app installed before I say yes.
* Facebook's mobile app <a href="http://www.efytimes.com/e1/fullnews.asp?edid=128859">snoops on SMS messages.</a>
* When useds log in to a site through Facebook, Facebook <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Be7mB2gIcAEZedw.png:large">
gives the site access to lots of information</a> about the used.
* acebook, as an 'experiment', <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/12/facebook-collects-conducts-research-on-status-updates-you-never-post/">collected</a> the text its useds started to enter as status updates and ultimately did not send.
* Facebook also announced it planned to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/10/facebook-may-start-logging-your-cursor-movements/">track mouse movement even in the absence of a click</a>.
* Facebook [refuses to deactivate old accounts]((http://www.smashcompany.com/philosophy/facebook-activated-my-dormant-account-and-it-wont-let-me-deactivate-it)) unless the used presents a government issued ID

These work by means of malicious Javascript code.

* Pages that contain Facebook "like" buttons enable Facebook to track
visitors to those pages. <a href='http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/facebooks-privacy-lie-aussie-exposes-tracking-as-new-patent-uncovered-20111004-1l61i.html'>Facebook
tracks Internet users</a> that see "like" buttons, even users who never visited
facebook.com and never click on those buttons. The ACLU has a way of enabling users to click a Facebook "like"
button, which avoids this problem.  Its pages have a link called "like us on Facebook" that leads to a Facebook page where it is possible to push a "like" button for the ACLU.  But if you don't follow that link, Facebook gets no information about your visit to the ACLU page.
* This page gives details about <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2011-11-15/facebook-privacy-tracking-data/51225112/1?loc=interstitialskip">how
much Facebook tracks people's browsing</a>, which applies even to people that don't have Facebook accounts.
* Facebook's tracking of useds through cookies combined with Like
buttons <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/31/facebook-tracks-all-visitors-breaching-eu-law-report">violates EU law</a>.
* Facebook has turned on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/08/facebook-privacy-facial-recognition">automatic face recognition on photos</a>.
* Facebook says that it only suggests identifications for faces in
photos for people who are the used's friends.  However, it might run
the algorithm over every photo posted and not publicly announce the
results. I ask people not to post photos of me on Facebook. You might want to
make the same request, for you and your children.
* Facebook <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/29/facebook-privacy-secret-profile-exposed">goes
to great lengths to hide some privacy settings</a>. Apparently it wants to claim useds have that option while making it so hard to find that people won't use it.
* Facebook exposes lovers to lots of information about each other which
can <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-facebook-could-be-threatening-your-romantic-relationship-60391">stimulate
jealousy</a>.
* Innocent-seeming text posted on Facebook could cause you lots of
trouble, due to development of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/24/facebook-generation-y">systems
to deduce things about you</a>.
* Facebook has automatically pushed useds' @facebook.com email addresses (which they never asked for) into the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/07/facebook-com-e-mail-plague-chokes-phone-address-books/">contact lists in other people's phones</a>.
* The lesson here is that it is a fundamental mistake to trust a company
such as Facebook to give anyone data about you.  It will give them the
data it wants them to have, not the data you want to give them.
* How did Mari Sherkin end up on a dating site unwillingly? Facebook opens browser windows showing other companies' sites, which <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto facebook-info-sharing-created-zoosk-com-dating-profile-for-married-woman-1.2844953">trick Facebook useds<a href="#used">*</a> into agreeing to let those companies get their personal data from Facebook</a>.

##### Profiling People {#profiling}
* Facebook may be able to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/01/facebook-target-mental-halth-data-online">identify whether each used is mentally ill or not</a>.
* Facebook
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/02/24/why-a-privacy-advocate-made-it-easy-to-track-when-your-facebook-friends-sleep/">can
tell when its useds are asleep</a>.  Via Facebook, others can tell that
too.
* When Facebook <a href="http://fusion.net/story/319108/facebook-phone-location-friend-suggestions/">sees
two useds are in the same physical location</a>, it may suggest that
the two 'friend' each other.

This can cause lots of trouble for people in certain circumstances. But remember that
<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2013-nov-feb.html#05_December_2013_(NSA_collects_5_billion_cell_phone_locations_per_day)">the NSA is doing the same thing</a>, and doesn't let you opt out &mdash; except the way I do, by not carrying a mobile phone.

* Facebook and Master Card will
<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/business-it/mastercard-to-mine-facebook-user-data-20141006-10qrqy.html">
join forces to profile Master Card customers</a> so banks can push them to spend more.
* By doing this, Master Card is ratting on its customers. This reinforces the point that using a credit card enables others to take advantage of you.
It also interferes with your efforts to limit your spending.
* Don't be tracked &mdash; pay cash.

<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/11/facebook-users-reveal-intimate-secrets">Many
things</a> can be determined about a Facebook used<a href="#used">*</a>, with pretty good
accuracy, from the used's published list of "likes".
If you do as I do, and reject Facebook, you are safe from this form
of snooping.
How can we get the news items that interest us, without telling a
server what criterion to use?  Simple: download lists of items, and
have software on our own machine decide which articles to show.  This
software can fetch additional articles (which it doesn't actually show
us) just to create a false trail.

<!-- <h3>Other People</h3>


Facebook predicts who new useds<a href="#used">*</a> know, based on their
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/04/02/how-facebook-knows-who-all-your-friends-are-even-better-than-you-do/">phone
lists and email address lists</a>.  Along with the phone and email
lists of all the other useds.

This is a measure of how complete and dangerous Facebook surveillance
is.

It implies that giving your email or phone list to a company is
mistreatment of everyone in that list!


The NSA
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/nsa-examines-social-networks-of-us-citizens.html?pagewanted=all">
tracks Americans' social networks</a>, and Facebook is just one of
its
sources.


Thus, if you talk about your friends in Facebook, you're ratting on
them.  If you say that you saw John and Arthur, you tell the NSA that
John knows Arthur.  If John and Arthur are dissidents, or journalists,
your information will help the government suppress dissent or
journalism.



Facebook invites useds<a href="#used">*</a> to nag other useds to fill in their
profiles with
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/05/facebook-introduces-naggy-ask-function-into-profile-pages/">
all sorts of personal information</a>.



Facebook has a new trick to get people to
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/step-1-identify-baby-photo-step-2-hide-baby-photos/">identify
their spouses and babies in photos</a>.


Facebook asks its useds to provide their entire list of <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/computing/networks/facebook-knows-your-friendseven-if-theyre-not-on-facebook"/>other people's
email addresses</a>.

This by itself is surveillance of those other people, but Facebook uses
it to go further and try to guess the relationships of people who are not
Facebook useds<a href="#used">*</a> (along with
<a href="https://spideroak.com/articles/facebook-shadow-profiles-a-profile-of-you-that-you-never-created">
collecting their phone
numbers, and email and postal addresses</a>).

That information must be worth some money to companies.  It is surely
worth money to the secret police of any country that isn't democratic
enough.

However, the principal wrong here is not that Facebook can guess which
non-useds know you or me.  It is that Facebook collects information
from its useds about whether they know you or me.

I think we can formulate the principle that any social network that
asks its members for information about other people is abusive.


Facebook apps have access to that used's<a href="#used">*</a> information &mdash; and the
useds' "friends'" information, too.  Thus, if you make the mistake of
using Facebook, even if you don't let a company access your data, <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/telecom/internet/stalking-on-facebook-is-easier-than-you-think">any of your
"friends" can give the company access to your data</a>.

<h2 id="ads">Ads</h2>

Facebook exploits its useds<a href="#used">*</a> by
<a href="http://www.itworld.com/internet/134677/facebook-ads-use-your-face-free">
conscripting them for ads</a>.


Facebook settled a lawsuit by promising useds will be able to <a
href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2012/06/21/facebook-must-let-users-opt-out-of-sponsored-stories-following-lawsuit-settlement/">'limit'
this use of their names and photos</a> in ads shown to other useds.
However, since this is "opt-out", by default useds will still be
exploited.  What's more, <a
href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/07/groups-get-facebook-millions/all/">
it may not even be a complete opt-out.</a>


Facebook will no longer allow useds to decline to let their names be
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531135817/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/30/facebook_data_usage_policy_rejigged_again/">used
in advertisements</a>.  More than ever, Facebook is really
Suckerberg.

In addition, Facebook secretly collects useds' phone numbers.
The article says it is not clear why.  Perhaps it's a favor for the
NSA.


Did the vegetarian used of Facebook<a href="#used">*</a> really "like" McDonalds,
or did Facebook make it up?  In fact,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161215092610/http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2013/01/21/facebook-is-recycling-your-likes-to-promote-stories-youve-never-seen-to-all-your-friends/#37137e96b233">Facebook
invents phony "likes"</a>, and worse, falsely suggests people
liked specific text that they had never even seen.

Facebook sends political messages as <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/is-facebook-damaging-your-reputation-with-sneaky-political-posts-7000000828/">coming from people who have clicked Like buttons</a>.

Facebook recently settled a lawsuit, promising to stop a very similar practice involving ads, but these political messages are not considered "ads" and Facebook continues to send them.

  Facebook lurkers are
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/facebook-break-can-boost-wellbeing-study-suggests">likely to feel happier if they stop being used
  by Facebook for at least a week</a>.


  If you want to "engage with others" more, how about doing it
  <em>outside</em> of Facebook?  That would provide the same benefits
  and would avoid giving Facebook any more information about you or
  the others you engage with.




  Facebook tends to lead its useds into
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/10/google-facebook-critical-thinking-computers">
    a sort of trance in which they believe</a>, more or less, whatever
  comes up in the feed.



Reading the feed on Facebook <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/31/stress/is-facebook-luring-you-into-being-depressed">makes many useds feel envy and sadness</a>.

They can reduce these feelings by posting more about themselves.
Thus, the system (Facebook and the used) pressures the used into
giving Facebook more personal data.



In some regions, 10% of Facebook useds <a href="http://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/">don't realize</a> that talking
to Facebook is using the internet.  And Facebook is directing
millions of people into having no internet access except to Facebook.

This is the sort of thing that a democratic society should prohibit,
for the same reason we prohibit other kinds of monopolies.


Why Facebook Is the

Junk Food of Socializing</a>.


Parents should regard Facebook as a sort of gang that you don't want
your kids to get mixed up in.


The competition for "likes" on Facebook lures teenagers to <a
href="http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/rushkoff20140405">procure
"likes" by any means necessary</a>, and no means is too sleazy.  The
way a player scores in this game is by selling the list of people who
"liked" him to a company, thus paying back favors with abuse; but
these useds<a href="#used">*</a> have adopted an amoral attitude in which they no longer
try to judge exploitation ethically.


This competition inculcates an amoral attitude in which nothing is
genuine and the only value is success.  I don't think that the desire
to build a career (no matter what kind) excuses this behavior.



A person's number of 'friends' on Facebook <a

A study found that being heavily used by Facebook

the hypothesis that people let Facebook use them more because they were sadder
to begin with.

This is not yet proof, but given so many other reasons to avoid Facebook,
why not take this precaution?



Another study shows that being used a lot by Facebook

 since people generally post an exaggerated positive
picture of their lives, their lives appear to be better than your own.

Facebook is a

Of course, it's not the only one, but that is no excuse.

<h2 id="racism">Racism</h2>


Facebook
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/facebooks-ad-platform-now-guesses-at-your-race-based-on-your-behavior/">guesses
the race of each used</a>, and companies use this to show people
different ads.


<hr>

Facebook has introduced
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/facebook-ad-discrimination/505703/">
a racial discrimination feature
</a>
that lets advertisers
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race/">
direct ads at people selected by race.
</a>


In response a group of Facebook useds have filed a lawsuit, which has led
Facebook to stop allowing discrimination,
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-to-stop-allowing-some-advertisers-to-exclude-users-by-race">
although only in the specific areas where that is illegal in the US.
</a>


In other words, Facebook supports racism as far as the law allows.



Facebook is effectively
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/facebook-explains-that-it-is-totally-not-doing-racial-profiling/">racially
profiling</a> its useds, in an indirect and deniable way.



How "personalization" done by Facebook, presented as a

subsume newspapers and magazines</a>, gaining
unprecedented power.

When a company has dangerous power, it is irrelevant whether it got
that "fairly" in a "in a competitive open market".  We should not let
that irrelevance distract us from what matters: protecting ourselves
from their power.


The Facebook news feed, seen as an instance of the AI apocalypse.

It is important to keep in mind that Facebook is bad for many other
reasons.  This is one more reason to oppose it, but we had plenty
already.

It is unfortunate that the article uses the term
<a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Content">"content"</a>
to refer to published text.  Just because CNN does that is no reason
why we should follow its example.

Facebook's automated "trending news stories", not edited by human
minds,
include
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-trending-false-news-stories">
bogus stories, clickbait and disinformation</a>.

Facebook's <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/05/14/feudalism-facebook-new-pay-play-news-feed-indy-media-killer">corporate-only news feed</a> both directs useds away from

<h2 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h2>



Facebook draws useds by promising interoperability,
<a href="http://joshuawise.com/contact/no-fb-messenger">
then eliminates
the interoperability once it gets them hooked</a>.  Here's how it did that
with XMPP for messaging.

The writer of that page has recognized that the power Facebook has
over its useds is dangerous, but hasn't thought it through to the
conclusion that we shouldn't let Facebook use us.



<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/05/facebook-deliberately-breaking-android-apps">
Facebook measured the depth of its grip over its useds</a>
by trying to drive them away with malfunctioning apps.
No matter how bad things got, the useds would not be driven away.



It is very important for you personally to
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/03/google-facebook-nothing-lasts-for-ever">refuse
to use Facebook</a>, <em>especially</em> if some of your friends do
(or might), because that's how you influence them, for good or for
ill.


Facebook
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/13/8775587/facebook-news-feed-uses-time-read-to-promote-posts">

Facebook now</a> &mdash; you are its product, not its customer.

Facebook says that a used <a href='http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-releasing-your-personal-data-reveals-our-trade-secrets/4552'>can't have Facebook's data</a> about him, because it's a trade secret.

A German regulator says that <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15290120,00.html"> Facebook's face recognition is illegal.</a>


It appears Facebook spontaneously sends phone messages to people in India who have had no connection with Facebook.  <a href="http://sosaysharis.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/anonymous-messages-from-facebook/">This person is trying to find out why</a>.


Facebook has put an outrageous
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/03/facebook-asserts-trademark-on-word-book-in-new-user-agreement.ars">trademark claim on the word "book"</a> into its terms of service.
To be dependent on Facebook, or any other specific company you could
not replace with another, is to make yourself vulnerable to unbounded
legal aggression.  Don't be a fool &mdash; unfriend Facebook today
rather than accept these terms.


A credit agency in Germany plans to evaluate people's creditworthiness
by who their '<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/critique-of-german-credit-agency-plan-to-mine-facebook-for-data-a-837713.html">friends</a>' are on Facebook.

The lesson is that we should make sure that no activities collect
information about lots of people's social networks.



Facebook is attempting to
<a href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/facebook_i_want_my_friends_back">
gouge companies and web sites</a> that use it to
keep in touch with their customers.


The attitude of this criticism is too narrowly commercial for me to
sympathize fully with it, and I expect that Facebook will reduce this
charge so as to avoid driving these customers away.  I am also
repelled by the shallowness that leads to thinking that Facebook in
April 2012 was good merely because it aided their commercial goals.


Nonetheless, this demonstrates the arrogant way Facebook treats anyone
that deals with it, which is a reason not to be one of them.

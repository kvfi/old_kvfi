&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This site is a semi-personal [knowledge base](./About) I've been building for the last 12 years. Parts of it are public and others are private. I mostly write about science, philosophy and programming. This is not a [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog), it's a open journal I use to share information and various thoughts. I'm known for being radical towards Internet privacy and online freedom.

Anyway, you're most welcome.

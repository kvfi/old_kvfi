&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="big">For as long as I remember</span> I've been trying to fuse science and arts together, altought I did it with limited and moderate success during the last 12 years, I managed to amass a body of work that some may find of interest. Parts of it are public and others are kept private for seclusion. I write about everything I find worth taking a look at. Altough it resembles it, this is not a [[blog|Blog]]&mdash; at least don't call it so. It's an open journal I use to gather information and miscellaneous thoughts on various topics. Over the years, I've been runnning this site, I accumulated sizeable content including 4000+ [essays](Essays), 700+ [poems](Poems) and 100+ [publications](Publications). 

You can learn more about me [here](About).

Be advised that I follow [[Crocker's rules|Crocker's rules]]. Anyway, you're most welcome. If you happen to have a question or remark, [contact me](./About#contact).

_NB: I DO NOT use social networks, if you want to keep up with the updates, check out the [Changelog](Changelog)._
